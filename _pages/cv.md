* Ph.D in School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University, 2024 (expected)
* B.S. in School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University, 2019

Research experience
======
* Bachelor project
  * Title: Electron- and ion-scale, nested magnetic cavities: Manifestation of cross-scale theta-pinches in space plasmas.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Xu-Zhi Zhou

* PhD project: Equilibrium model for magnetic structures
  * 2019.9-2021.2: Construct self-consistent kinetic models to describe the nested and helical magnetic cavities, respectively, and investigate the 90â—¦-concentrated and donut-shaped electron pitch angle distributions.
  * 2023.1-2023.7: Use the self-consistent kinetic model above to reconstruct an ion-vortex magnetic hole with reversed field direction.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Xu-Zhi Zhou

* PhD project: wave-particle interactions
  * 2020.5-now: Use the MMS spacecraft measurements to identify resonances from the direct observations.
